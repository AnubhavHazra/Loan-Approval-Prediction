# Loan-Approval-Prediction
This project explores the application of two prominent machine learning classification algorithms — Logistic Regression and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) — to the problem of loan approval prediction. Using a real-world dataset consisting of customer financial and demographic data, we compare the two models in terms of performance, interpretability, and diagnostic robustness.

Objectives:
1.Predict the loan approval status (approved/rejected) based on customer features.

2.Apply and interpret the results of Logistic Regression and KNN.

3.Perform data diagnostics such as multicollinearity and influence analysis.

4.Evaluate and compare the models using metrics like accuracy, ROC curves, and confusion matrices.

5.Recommend the better suited model for the task based on both predictive power and interpretability.
